Confidence level
Zscore = (x-mue)/(sigma/root of n)
p-value PR(Hypo|Data)
interval estimate = point estimate +- margin of error == X dash +- Z Aplha/2 * sigma/root n

frequency of each of the level. 

train data -> seen data
test data  -> unseen data

parametric test -> assume data ex.Linear Regression
non-parametric test -> doesn't assume data


Assumption :-

-> target variable numeric in nature
-> 2 or more independent variable which can be both numerical and catagarical 
-> There should not be any MultiCollinearity
-> There should not be any AutoCorrelation
-> There should not be any HeteroSkedasticity

MultiCollinearity:- Is a situation where your independent variables are highly correlated
